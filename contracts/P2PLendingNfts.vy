@notice This contract facilitates peer-to-peer lending using NFTs as collateral.
@dev It facilitates peer-to-peer lending using NFTs as collateral.
      The contract allows lenders to offer loans and borrowers to accept them by providing NFTs as collateral.
      Key functionalities include:
      - Creating and managing loan offers
      - Accepting loan offers and locking NFTs as collateral
      - Accepts ERC721 and CryptoPunks NFTs as collateral
      - Delegating the collateral using [Delegate](https://delegate.xyz/) DelegateRegistry v2
      - Settling loans by repaying the principal and interest
      - Claiming collateral in case of loan default
      - Replacing existing loans with new terms
      - Four types of fees are supported: protocol fee, origination fee, lender broker fee, and borrower broker fee
      - Managing protocol fees and authorized proxies
      - Handling ownership transfer of the contract
      - Loan state is kept hashed in the contract to save gas
      The contract ensures secure and transparent lending operations within the Zharta ecosystem.
